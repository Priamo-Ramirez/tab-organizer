# Tab Organizer â€“ Privacy Policy

**No data collection.** Tab Organizer does not collect, store, or share any personal information or browsing data.

The extension works entirely within your browser and only reorders the positions of your open tabs by hostname. It does not read page contents, and it does not send any data to external servers.

## Permissions
The extension requests only the `tabs` permission to read the list of open tabs and reorder them. No host permissions are requested.

## Contact
If you have questions or concerns, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
